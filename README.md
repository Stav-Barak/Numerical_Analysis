# Numerical_Analysis
This project focuses on implementing various numerical analysis and optimization techniques in Python. It covers topics such as interpolation, function intersections, definite integrals, curve fitting, and shape area computation.

assignment1: interpolation - Provides a method for interpolating a function using cubic Bezier curves, designed to minimize interpolation error while balancing computational efficiency.

assignment2: function intersections - Includes a method to determine intersection points between two functions within a defined range.

assignment3: area between curves - Offers methods to calculate the area enclosed between two functions and perform numerical integration.

assignment4: curve fitting - Specializes in fitting a model function to noisy data points derived from a function, while maintaining constraints on running time.

assignment5: shape_area - Provides methods for fitting a shape to noisy contour data points and calculating the area of the fitted shape using numerical integration methods.
